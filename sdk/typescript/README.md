# Getting Started with Stood platform API

## Introduction

Every request carries the platform key (Authorization: Bearer) and a Stood-Signature: t=<unix seconds>,v2=<hex HMAC-SHA256 over the canonical request>, within five minutes. Bodies are at most 64 KiB. Stood only talks to the PayPal sandbox.

## Building

### Requirements

The SDK relies on **Node.js** and **npm** (to resolve dependencies). It also requires **Typescript version >=4.1**. You can download and install Node.js and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

> **NOTE:** npm is installed by default when Node.js is installed.

### Verify Successful Installation

Run the following commands in the command prompt or shell of your choice to check if Node.js and npm are successfully installed:

* Node.js: `node --version`

* npm: `npm --version`

### Install Dependencies

- To resolve all dependencies, go to the **SDK root directory** and run the following command with npm:

```bash
npm install
```

- This will install all dependencies in the **node_modules** folder.

## Installation

The following section explains how to use the generated library in a new project.

### 1. Initialize the Node Project

- Open an IDE/text editor for JavaScript like Visual Studio Code. The basic workflow presented here is also applicable if you prefer using a different editor or IDE.

- Click on **File** and select **Open Folder**. Select an empty folder of your project, the folder will become visible in the sidebar on the left.

![Open Folder](https://apidocs.io/illustration/typescript?step=openProject)

- To initialize the Node project, click on **Terminal** and select **New Terminal**. Execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm init --y
```

### 2. Add Dependencies to the Client Library

- The created project manages its dependencies using its `package.json` file. In order to add a dependency on the *Stood platform APILib* client library, double click on the `package.json` file in the bar on the left and add the dependency to the package in it.

![Add StoodPlatformApilib Dependency](https://apidocs.io/illustration/typescript?workspaceFolder=StoodPlatformApi&workspaceName=stood-platform-apilib&step=importDependency)

- To install the package in the project, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

## Initialize the API Client

**_Note:_** Documentation for the client can be found [here.](doc/client.md)

The following parameters are configurable for the API Client:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| timeout | `number` | Timeout for API calls.<br>*Default*: `30000` |
| httpClientOptions | [`Partial<HttpClientOptions>`](doc/http-client-options.md) | Stable configurable http client options. |
| unstableHttpClientOptions | `any` | Unstable configurable http client options. |
| logging | [`PartialLoggingOptions`](doc/partial-logging-options.md) | Logging Configuration to enable logging |
| platformKeyCredentials | [`PlatformKeyCredentials`](doc/auth/oauth-2-bearer-token.md) | The credential object for platformKey |
| requestSignatureCredentials | [`RequestSignatureCredentials`](doc/auth/custom-header-signature.md) | The credential object for requestSignature |

The API client can be initialized as follows:

### Code-Based Client Initialization

```ts
import { Client, LogLevel } from 'stood-platform-apilib';

const client = new Client({
  platformKeyCredentials: {
    accessToken: 'AccessToken'
  },
  requestSignatureCredentials: {
    'Stood-Signature': 'Stood-Signature'
  },
  timeout: 30000,
  logging: {
    logLevel: LogLevel.Info,
    logRequest: {
      logBody: true
    },
    logResponse: {
      logHeaders: true
    }
  },
});
```

### Configuration-Based Client Initialization

```ts
import * as path from 'path';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import { Client } from 'stood-platform-apilib';

// Provide absolute path for the configuration file
const absolutePath = path.resolve('./config.json');

// Read the configuration file content
const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(absolutePath, 'utf-8');

// Initialize client from JSON configuration content
const client = Client.fromJsonConfig(fileContent);
```

See the [Configuration-Based Client Initialization](doc/configuration-based-client-initialization.md) section for details.

### Environment-Based Client Initialization

```ts
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import * as path from 'path';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import { Client } from 'stood-platform-apilib';

// Optional - Provide absolute path for the .env file
const absolutePath = path.resolve('./.env');

if (fs.existsSync(absolutePath)) {
  // Load environment variables from .env file
  dotenv.config({ path: absolutePath, override: true });
}

// Initialize client using environment variables
const client = Client.fromEnvironment(process.env);
```

See the [Environment-Based Client Initialization](doc/environment-based-client-initialization.md) section for details.

## Authorization

This API uses the following authentication schemes.

* [`platformKey (OAuth 2 Bearer token)`](doc/auth/oauth-2-bearer-token.md)
* [`requestSignature (Custom Header Signature)`](doc/auth/custom-header-signature.md)
